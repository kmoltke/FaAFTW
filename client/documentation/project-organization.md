# Project collaboration rules

## Git flow

We have agreed to have a main branch which will be our production branch, together with three other branches called pr1, pr2 and pr3 which will contain, at the date of each deliverable, the finished versiones of mini project 1, mini project 2, mini project 3.

For example: for the mini project 1, all new features developed will be done in feature branches and pushed to mp1. Before the delivery date, we will merge mp1 with main, to update our production branch.

- main
- mp1 (for mini project 1)
- mp2 (for mini project 2)
- mp3 (for mini project 3)
- feature branches

### Requirements

- Product: vinils

- Product taxonomy: we will first offer categories splitted by speed(low, high), size and genre(jazz, hip-hop, etc.).
