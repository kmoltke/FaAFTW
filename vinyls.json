Originally released on March 1, 1973, on the label Harvest, it built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, but departs from instrumental thematic by founding member Syd Barrett. The album explores themes including conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state."

Nevermind is the second studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the group's first release on DGC Records. Frontman Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and their use of \"loud/quiet\" dynamics. It is their first album to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Despite low commercial expectations by the band and its record label, Nevermind became a surprise success in late 1991, largely due to the popularity of its first single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" By January 1992, it had replaced Michael Jackson's album, Dangerous, at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album also produced three other successful singles: \"Come as You Are,\" \"Lithium,\" and \"In Bloom.\""
